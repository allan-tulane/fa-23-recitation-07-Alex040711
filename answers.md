- **2) W=O(n+m)**
- **4) 1**
- **5) W=O(n+m)**
- **7) Switching the graph representation to an adjacency matrix would change the work done by the reachable function. In an adjacency matrix, iterating over neighbors of a node requires scanning its entire row, which is an **O**(**n**) operation regardless of the number of edges(m). Therefore, the overall work of the reachable function becomes O(n^2), where **n** is the number of nodes, making it more costly for large graphs compared to an adjacency list representation.**
